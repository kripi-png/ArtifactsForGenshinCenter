# V2 Rewrite

Some sort of a TODO:
- [ ] use a library to validate the editor data; especially the set's name?
  - [ArkType](https://arktype.io/) seems pretty fast
- [ ] translations
  - perhaps store a ID for sets in the dataset, and have localizations bundled with the extension
  - default language to same as 1) browser's 2) Genshin Center's 3) user choice
- [ ] notification system for updates
  - similar to dataset, read changelog or such from GitHub repo
- [ ] port to Firefox and publish

## New features / suggestions in consideration
- field for notes, shared between all artifacts, and displayed below the artifacts?
- field for artifact level?

# Artifacts for Genshin Center
**NOTE: This is an unofficial extension developed by [@kripi-png](https://github.com/kripi-png), and NOT Genshin Center.**
While the Developer of GC knows about the extension and it is mentioned in their FAQ, it is not supported by GC and is solely maintained by me.

A chrome extension for [Genshin Center's Ascension Planner](https://genshin-center.com/planner).
It helps users with planning which artifacts they want to get for their Genshin Impact character.
It is also possible to set the main and sub stats for the artifacts and mark them as obtained in-game.

**The extension is available on [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/artifacts-for-genshin-pla/jleonalkkhbfeafkmfgofopiadjkalno)!**

## Features
- Each character has 5 slots for artifacts.
- When clicked, the user can select the set (from a list) and write down the main and sub stats.
- When a slot with an artifact is hovered, a pop-up will show the stats along with the name of the set
- In the options menu, there are buttons for exporting and importing artifact save data.
  - Syncing between user's devices is currently not possible, but this allows for sharing the data between devices (or users)
  - This is NOT for the GOOD-format or such. It is only for the data generated by the extension itself.

### Development
**Note**: the project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) instead of npm.

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
3. Run `pnpm dev` to start the project and generate the dist\ directory
4. Navigate to chrome://extensions/ and enable Developer Mode from top-right corner.
5. Click Load Unpacked button on top-left, and select the dist\chrome-mv3\ directory
6. Navigate to https://genshin-center.com/planner. Everything should now work.

**Note**: It is also possible to configure wxt to auto-start a browser with the extension and clean state. Follow instructions [here](https://wxt.dev/guide/essentials/config/browser-startup.html).

When the source code is changed, WXT automatically rebuilds the dist\ directory and reloads the extension.
